Description: This package provides classes for holding and manipulating
	     Illumina methylation data.  Based on eSet, it can contain MIAME
	     information, sample information, feature information, and
	     multiple matrices of data.  An "intelligent" import function,
	     methylumiR can read the Illumina text files and create a
	     MethyLumiSet. Normalization and quality control features are also
	     included.
